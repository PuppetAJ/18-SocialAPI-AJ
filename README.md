# Module 18 Social Network API challenge


![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)


## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 18 social network API challenge submission. 

The project utilizes mongoDB and express to create a backend for a hypothetical social network to use. It allows a site to create, update, and delete users from the database, as well as allows users to create, update, and delete thoughts, which function as their "posts". Users can also create reactions to posts and delete those posts if necessary. All routes and controllers are complete, meaning it would be functional if integrated into a working front-end environment. In addition, if a user is deleted from the database, their thoughts are deleted as well.
